## Transformer
#### Transformer for json, yaml and xml files

The main purpose of this project is to consolidate what I know, apply, learn new things, understand file systems and at the end of the day serve humanity :)

This project aims to convert json, yaml and xml files to each other.

During the conversion process, the file format will be checked first. An error-free conversion process occurs when files are exported in error-free formats.

Users will have access to this conversion process in two ways. They will be able to get service either with the command line or with the rest api.
